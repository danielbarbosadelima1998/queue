⚠️ **Work in Progress** — This project is under active development and not ready for production yet.

# 🚀 Ultra-lightweight Queue Engine in Go

An **ultra-lightweight queue engine**, written in **Golang**, designed to support **thousands of sequential queues** with **high performance**, **low memory usage**, and **reliable persistence**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

This project aims to create a **simple, fast, and independent** queue solution — without relying on complex external systems like RabbitMQ or Kafka.  
The goal is to achieve an architecture capable of handling **millions of messages per second**, focusing on:

- ⚡ Extreme efficiency: minimal overhead per queue.
- 🧱 Horizontal scalability: native support for thousands of concurrent queues.
- 🎛️ Efficient batch processing: a publisher and consumer designed to work in batches, maximizing performance and resource utilization.
- 🚀 Ultra-low latency & high throughput: optimized communication for near real-time processing at massive scale.
- 💾 Reliable persistence: no message loss, even under failure conditions.
- 🧩 Simplicity: easy to use, embed, and understand.

## 🧩 Current State

The project is in an **early development stage** — currently defining the architecture and building the first prototypes.  
The core is being written entirely in **Go**, focusing on **performance** and **code clarity**.

> ⚠️ This repository is **not ready for production** yet, but **contributions and ideas are welcome!**

## 💡 Philosophy

> **“Less protocol, more purpose.”**

Most modern queue systems are designed to solve every possible problem — but in doing so, they carry a significant cost in **complexity** and **overhead**.  
Protocols, brokers, network layers, replication — all of these have a price, often paid in **latency** and **resource consumption**.

This project takes a different path:  
focus on **pure performance and a clear purpose** — to create and manage **thousands of sequential queues** with **minimal client impact** and **no unnecessary dependencies**.

Each queue is **simple, predictable, and direct** — it processes messages in order, respects available resources, and requires no heavy infrastructure.

The result is a **transparent, optimized, and efficient** queue engine — built to solve a **specific problem** with **clarity and total control**.
